class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    # up method should create our table with name and breed columns.
    create_table :dogs do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :breed
    end
  end

  def down
    # down method should drop the table.
    drop_table :dogs
  end
end
#
# The change method is actually a shorter way of writing up and down methods. We can refactor our migration to look like this:
# class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration
#   def change
#     create_table :dogs do |t|
#       t.string :name
#       t.string :breed
#     end
#   end
#
# end
# While the rollback (down) method is not included, it's implicit in the change method. Rolling back the database would work in exactly the same way as using the down
